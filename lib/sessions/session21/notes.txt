* If some widgets in the screen require change in its data (state), doesn't mean that the
whole page should be stateful widget, but only the widget itself.

** Widgets that use state:
1. Switches --- SwitchListTile
2. Radio Buttons --- RadioListTile
    group value is the one that will be changed no the value.
3. Check Box --- CheckboxListTile
4. TextField
    1. onChanged vs onSubmitted
    2. Attributes:
        1. keyboardType
        2. maxLength
        3. readOnly
        4. label vs hint
